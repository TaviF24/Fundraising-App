Your fundraising web application that lets you help other people or ask for help.

## Overview
A web3 based application built on top of a blockchain, which allows fundraising for humanitarian causes. <br><br>
Within this application, you can: 
+ create a **Campaign**, 
+ create custom **Tiers** which are multiple options of donations, 
+ **Donate** to a campaign, 
+ check the real price of an **ethereum**, 
+ and much more.

## What you need 
There are two main things that you need:
+ A software cryptocurrency **wallet** (e.g. Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Rabby etc.);
+ A good will :).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the wallet you need to have tokens used in the application's network, in this case the network is Sepolia, which is a test network and the token used is **Sepolia ETH** (not ETH). For now, I will let the application to be on a test network.
